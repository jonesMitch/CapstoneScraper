# CapstoneScraper

Installation:
You just have to install "bs4" and "requests" through pip and everything should work.

To run the scraper, add the names of all the stations whose pictures you want to the stakes.txt file, with each name on seperate lines. Spelling matters, but capitalization does not.

If you want every image from the website, leave the stakes.txt file blank.
